# Matrix Factorization Comparison

This repository contains implementations of various matrix factorization techniques in Python. The implemented algorithms are:

1. QR Decomposition
2. QR Francis Algorithm
3. Hessenberg Reduction

## Files and Directories

- `qr_decomposition.py`: Implementation of the QR Decomposition algorithm.
- `qr_francis.py`: Implementation of the QR Francis algorithm for eigenvalue computation.
- `hessenberg_reduction.py`: Implementation of Hessenberg Reduction for eigenvalue computation.
- `test_matrix_factorization.py`: Test cases to verify the correctness of the implemented algorithms.
- `plot_results.py`: Script to compare the results of different factorization techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib` (or use a virtual environment).
2. Run the `plot_results.py` script to execute the benchmark tests on the implemented models.
3. Adjust the test cases or add your own test cases in `test.py` to further explore the models.
4. Modify and experiment with the models' implementations in their respective files.
5. Analyze the results, compare the performance, and draw insights based on the benchmark tests and your modifications.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs.
