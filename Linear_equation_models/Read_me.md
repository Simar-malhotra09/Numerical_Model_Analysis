# Linear Algebra Models for Solving Linear Equations

This project explores different linear algebra models for solving linear equations. It implements and compares four basic models: Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Matrix Inversion, and Iterative Methods.

## Project Structure

- `gaussian_elimination.py`: Contains the implementation of the Gaussian elimination method for solving linear equations.
- `lu_decomposition.py`: Includes the implementation of LU decomposition for solving linear equations.
- `matrix_inversion.py`: Provides the implementation of matrix inversion for solving linear equations.
- `test.py`: Includes a set of standardized test cases to evaluate and compare the models.
- `plot_results.py`: Runs benchmark tests on the models using the test cases to measure their performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.0 and above
- NumPy
- Other necessary dependencies (e.g., matplotlib for plotting)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib` (or use a virtual environment).
2. Run the `plot_results.py` script to execute the benchmark tests on the implemented models.
3. Adjust the test cases or add your own test cases in `test.py` to further explore the models.
4. Modify and experiment with the models' implementations in their respective files.
5. Analyze the results, compare the performance, and draw insights based on the benchmark tests and your modifications.
